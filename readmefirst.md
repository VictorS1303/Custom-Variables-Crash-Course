### END TASK DESCRIPTION ###

As you may realize, this quickly becomes very repititive, and annoying to have to do manually for each value (even with such a small project like this).
There has to be a better and more effecient way of doing this (surprise, there is), and that's where custom variables/properties come in to play.
